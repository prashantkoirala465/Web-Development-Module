Please note: This is a placeholder for a video thumbnail image.
In a real project, this would be an actual image file.
For the purposes of this exercise, you should download an image that represents a video tutorial and save it as video-thumbnail.jpg.

A video thumbnail for a web development tutorial could show code on screen, a person explaining something, or a combination of both with a title overlay.

Example usage in HTML:
<img src="images/video-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Video Tutorial">
