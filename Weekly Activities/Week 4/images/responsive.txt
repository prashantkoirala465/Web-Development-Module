Please note: This is a placeholder for a responsive design illustration image.
In a real project, this would be an actual image file.
For the purposes of this exercise, you should download an image that illustrates responsive design (showing a website on different devices) and save it as responsive.jpg.

A responsive design illustration typically shows the same website displayed on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile phone) demonstrating how the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

Example usage in HTML:
<img src="images/responsive.jpg" alt="Responsive Design Illustration">
