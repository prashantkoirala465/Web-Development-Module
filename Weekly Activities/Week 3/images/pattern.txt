Please note: This is a placeholder for a pattern image.
In a real project, this would be an actual image file.
For the purposes of this exercise, you should download a simple pattern image and save it as pattern.png.

Pattern images are typically small, repeating designs that tile seamlessly when used as backgrounds.

Example usage in CSS:
background-image: url('images/pattern.png');
background-repeat: repeat;
